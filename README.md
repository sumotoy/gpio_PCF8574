# gpio_PCF8574


A complete library for NTX PCF8574 and PCF8574A http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCF8574.pdf, a 8 port I/O GPIO with Interrupt, that works by using just 2 shared CPU pins by using I2C<br>
The library can be easily included in other libraries, has methods that let's you change ports values fastly and you can easily access chip register directly.<br>
This library has been extracted from my universal gpio_library and I will maintain separately.<br>
I have included several examples but a complete wiki and detailed images will be published soon.
